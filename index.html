            <p>I have completed my undergraduate from the University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh. Although I have majored in marketing, my interest lies in anything creative from arts to film making. Currently I am devoting my time to learn my newly found passion, web development and coding. I wants to establish a meaningful career working in a field where I can express my creativity and explore solutions to the countless problems in our society.</p> <br>

            <h3>“Don't wait for inspiration. <br> It comes while working." - Henri Matisse</h3>
            <p>I always try to work on things which inspires me and which I feel passionate about. My works are different than each other. Because when I work on anything, I make sure I create something creative and express my feelings through that work.</p>
